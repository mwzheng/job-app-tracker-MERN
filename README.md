# Job App Tracker w/ Backend

![Application Preview](preview.png)

Simple full stack application to help you keep track of your job applications, while you're job hunting. Stores data into MongoDb as you enter, delete or update your applications. 

This is my attempt at redoing my [job app tracker](https://github.com/mwzheng/job-application-tracker), which previously didn't have a backend and stored data into localStorage.

The project is made using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)

### TODO:
In server directory, create a .env file and add your Mongodb url & port number (See sample.env for an example)

### To Run:
- $ `cd server`
- $ `npm install`
- $ `npm start`
- $ `cd ../client`
- $ `npm install`
- $ `npm start`
